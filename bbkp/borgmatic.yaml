    # Number of seconds between each checkpoint during a

    # Name of the archive. Borg placeholders can be used. See the
    # output of "borg help placeholders" for details. Defaults to
    # "{hostname}-{now:%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%f}". If you specify this
    # option, you must also specify a prefix in the retention
    # section to avoid accidental pruning of archives with a
    # different archive name format. And you should also specify a
    # prefix in the consistency section as well.

    # Additional options to pass directly to particular Borg
    # commands, handy for Borg options that borgmatic does not yet

# Retention policy for how many backups to keep in each category. See
# https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage/prune.html for
# details. At least one of the "keep" options is required for pruning
# to work. To skip pruning entirely, run "borgmatic create" or "check"
# without the "prune" action. See borgmatic documentation for details.
retention:
    # Keep all archives within this time interval.

    # Number of hourly archives to keep.

    # When pruning, only consider archive names starting with this

    # "{hostname}-". Use an empty value to disable the default.

# Consistency checks to run after backups. See

consistency:
    # List of one or more consistency checks to run: "repository",
    # "archives", "data", and/or "extract". Defaults to
    # "repository" and "archives". Set to "disabled" to disable
    # all consistency checks. "repository" checks the consistency
    # of the repository, "archives" checks all of the archives,
    # "data" verifies the integrity of the data within the
    # archives, and "extract" does an extraction dry-run of the
    # most recent archive. Note that "data" implies "archives".
    checks:
        - repository
        - archives

    # Paths to a subset of the repositories in the location
    # section on which to run consistency checks. Handy in case
    # some of your repositories are very large, and so running
    # consistency checks on them would take too long. Defaults to
    # running consistency checks on all repositories configured in
    # the location section.
    # check_repositories:
        # - user@backupserver:sourcehostname.borg

    # Restrict the number of checked archives to the last n.
    # Applies only to the "archives" check. Defaults to checking
    # all archives.
    # check_last: 3

    # When performing the "archives" check, only consider archive
    # names starting with this prefix. Borg placeholders can be
    # used. See the output of "borg help placeholders" for
    # details. Defaults to "{hostname}-". Use an empty value to
    # disable the default.
    prefix: "{hostname}"

# Options for customizing borgmatic's own output and logging.
#hooks:
    # Apply color to console output. Can be overridden with
    # --no-color command-line flag. Defaults to true.
